# Virtual Storage Library (VirtStorageLib)


VirtStorageLib is a cross-platform C++ library implementing key-value storage. It allows the construction of virtual storages by mounting nodes from "physical" volumes. 
Library tests have been created with _GoogleTest_. The library has been tested against Windows 11 and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 

For running tests on Windows/Linux, please, launch _build.bat/build.sh_ from the _VirtStorageLib_ directory.
